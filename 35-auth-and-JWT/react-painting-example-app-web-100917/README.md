## React Router Components

### Router
Will use 1 place in our application (and one place only).
Very top level, essentially listening for when the route changes, and making that info accessible

### Route
Conditionally render a certain component based on what the route looks like

### Link
Changes the url we see in the browser, must have a 'to' prop

### Switch
Pick one of the following routes (the first that matches), dont look at the others (like an if/ else if/ else if)

### Redirect
